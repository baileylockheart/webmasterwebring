<h2>About the webring!</h2>
<p>The long version of why I wanted to make this webring can be found in <a href="https://lockheart.love/blog/2025~01~25" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, so I'll try to keep this short:</p>
<h3>I think everyone should have a website.</h3>
<p>It's truly that simple. I think everyone should have a website, regardless of skill level - I want personal websites to become mainstream again, but that necessitates being okay with and even encouraging of the use of site builders. Inconvenience is counter-culture, yes, but in order for something to become <i>culture</i>, it has to be something people are willing and able to do. Not everyone has the time or energy to pick up coding, but I KNOW that a lot of people are willing to make a carrd listing out their interests and showing off their art, or a google site about their stories.</p>
<p>So many webrings are out there, and it's wonderful getting to surf through them, but the vast majority of them specify that all sites <i>must</i> be hand-coded, and I feel like that simple restriction blocks out a lot more people than we'd like to think. Interesting and creative sites can be made with site-builders, and websites built on pre-made layouts are still websites!! Because of this, I wanted to make a webring that allows sites of all kinds :&rpar;</p>
