<h2>Rules for joining!</h2>
<p>If you'd like to join the webring, make sure to keep these in mind!</p>
<ol>
    <li>You need a website! Sites made with site builders (carrd, strawpage, etc) are allowed so long as you're running it, and Tumblr websites are allowed if customized! Any site will do as long as you can add the webring links, and it follows the other rules!</li>
    <br>
    <li>The main exception to the previous is AI generated sites. AI assisted coding is pushed enough by Github and similar entities that I won't turn you away for using it, but no fully AI generated sites!</li>
    <br>
    <li>No bigotry or discrimination of any kind (Zionists, TERFs, LGBTphobia, racism, sexism, etc.)! I WILL look at your site before I add your site to the ring</li>
    <br>
    <li>No solely commercial sites! Personal sites with self-promotion are ABSOLUTELY allowed, but company-run websites/websites with the sole intention of selling something are not. Similarly, no NFTs or cryptocurrency.</li>
    <br>
    <li>No entirely empty sites! Please have something on your site, even if it's just a home page. Your site can be under construction, and sites that are actively being built are encouraged to join, so long as there's SOMETHING there already!</li>
    <br>
    <li>NSFW/18+ sites are allowed to join, but need to mark their sites as 18+ when applying!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've read and agreed to follow these rules, head on over to the <a href="/join.html">join</a> page!</p>
